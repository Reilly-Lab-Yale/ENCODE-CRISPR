Code and peaks calls corresponding to each peak caller used in Figure 4 (GATA1) and/or Supplementary Figure xx (GITR). are included within each subdirectory. For aggrDESeq2 and CASA, two experiments were analyzed (GATA1 CRISPRi in K562 cells, GITR CRISPRi in T-reg cells). The other peak callers were used to analyze the GATA1 CRISPRi experiment in K562 cells.
